I'm an undergraduate at the University of Michigan interested in pretty much anything computer or math related. Specifically, I'm interested in areas of cryptography, algorithm design, machine learning, render engines, software systems, and a bunch of other mathy things.

Movies and visual effects are also super cool too!
